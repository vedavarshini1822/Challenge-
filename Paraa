About hackathon 
ChatGPT said:
A hackathon is an event where people come together—usually for a short, intensive period like 24 to 72 hours—to collaborate on building innovative projects, typically involving software or hardware development. The name combines “hack” (in the sense of clever problem-solving or coding) and “marathon.”

🔧 What Happens at a Hackathon?
Teams Form: Participants (called “hackers”) often form teams based on skills or project ideas.

Problem Solving: Teams identify a problem and brainstorm a solution, usually in the form of a web app, mobile app, or hardware prototype.

Development Sprint: Coding, designing, testing, and building happen in a short, focused burst of time.

Pitching: At the end, teams present their projects to a panel of judges or other participants.

Prizes & Recognition: Winners may receive cash, mentorship, internships, or other rewards.
